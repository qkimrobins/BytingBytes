#  StartupOps – BytingBytes Platform

A unified **digital operational workspace** designed for early-stage founders to efficiently manage execution, validate ideas, collaborate with teams, and gain actionable insights to grow their startup.


##  Project Overview

**StartupOps** is a full-stack web application that serves as an operational workspace for founders. It combines a modern, responsive frontend with a scalable backend API — enabling features for:

- Idea prioritization & validation
- Execution tracking and task management
- Team collaboration and communication
- Scalable architecture for future product features

This repository includes both the **frontend UI** and backend **API server**, along with all configuration and tooling necessary to run locally or deploy to production.


##  Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|------|------------|
| **Frontend** | Next.js (React) with App Router |
| **Styling** | Tailwind CSS |
| **Backend** | Node.js + Express |
| **Authentication** | JWT (JSON Web Tokens) |
| **Deployment** | Vercel (Frontend), Render (Backend) |
| **Languages Used** | TypeScript, JavaScript, CSS |
| **Configs & Tooling** | Nix, Prisma, Tailwind, PostCSS |

##  How It Works

###  Frontend (Next.js + Tailwind CSS)
The frontend is built using **Next.js App Router** and styled with **Tailwind CSS**:
- Fast client-side navigation with React
- Responsive, mobile-first UI
- Reusable, component-based architecture
- API integration via fetch requests

>The frontend communicates with the backend using REST APIs secured with JWT authentication.


###  Backend (Node.js + Express)
The backend handles all core business logic and data flow:
- User authentication using JWT
- Secure API endpoints
- Middleware for validation and protection
- Database connectivity and models
-
>JWT tokens are sent from the frontend in request headers to access protected routes.


##  Getting Started (Local Development)

###  Prerequisites
Make sure you have:
- Node.js v18+
- NPM
- Git
- VS Code (recommended)

###  1. Clone the Repository


```bash
git clone https://github.com/qkimrobins/BytingBytes.git
cd BytingBytes

2. Install Dependencies
npm install

3. Run the Backend Server
cd src
npm run dev
[ Backend runs on:http://localhost:5000 ]

4. Run the Frontend
cd ..
npm run dev
[ Frontend runs on:http://localhost:3000 ]

5.Environment Variables
Create a .env file and configure:
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key

Deployment
Frontend: Vercel ```
```

✅Backend: Render / any Node hosting service
Both platforms support GitHub CI/CD and environment variables.
